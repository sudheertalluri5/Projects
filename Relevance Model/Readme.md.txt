This is one of major projects which I did as a part of Internship at credit suisse. This model quantifies the relation between an entity and a document so that we will be able to find out which documents are more related to that entity by considering direct and indirect relevance of the document with that entity. There isn't much detailed explanation and datasets of this project because I'm allowed to take out some part of the project according to bank policies.
